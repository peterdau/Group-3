Assignment 3 Readme
===================
There are two files, one for each problem.  

1. **assignment3_problem1.py**
   Gives you starter code functions to obtain the mean, smallest value, largest value, and standard deviation of a population. The population is provided as a list.

   Your task is to calculate the z-score for
   - the mean,
   - the smallest value, and
   - the largest value of the population

   *Do not alter the starter functions or define any new ones.* Do not call any library methods. You may use arithmetic operators.

   The z-score function is named but you will need to complete it by writing the necessary parameters, the code within the function, and the return statement. You should also write the docstring. 

   Finally, call the function with the necessary arguments and compare the results with your expected output. 

2. **assignment3_problem2.py**
   Gives you starter code functions to compute the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives from a list of diagnoses. The list of diagnoses is provided also. 

   Your task is to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the test that produced the diagnoses. 

   *Do not alter the starter functions or define any new ones.* Do not call any library methods. You may use arithmetic operators.

   The sensitivity and specificity functions are written for you, but you will need to complete them with parameters, code to calculate the sensitivity/specificity, and the return statement. You should also write the docstring. 

   Finally, finish the statements that call both functions with the needed arguments and compare the results with the expected output from your testing plan.
